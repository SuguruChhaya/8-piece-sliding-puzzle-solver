The idea of the A* algorithm makes sense. 

But I need a G-score and an H-score. I am not totally sure how to calculate the H score yet. 
Tim calculated it with manhattan distance

I need some kind of algo to calculate H score. 
If 9 is on the right side, it would usually take about 2 additional steps. 

I think I really shouldn't be caring too much about individual steps. 
Honestly, for the h-score, I think I can just loop through every element and see how far it is 
from its correct position. Per 1 row difference, I should add 1 to the h score.
